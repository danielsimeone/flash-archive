SD card with wifi + paper archival source +flash-archive = efficiently dealing with archival materials


At present, this script is known to work:
--from the linux command line (tested on ubuntu)
--using	Python 3.4
--using a Toshiba FlashAir SD card with WIFI in a Sony Alpha 35 camera (should work with most cameras that take full-size SD cards)


Features to be added:
--support for other SD card/WIFI combos.  If you have one, let me know, and we can try to add that in.
--Windows and OSX support. The latter should be easy enough, and for the former, I've no idea. Might be easy too. I don't use either, so your help testing would be useful.
