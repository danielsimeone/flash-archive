#1 Fail after a long period of time of being on
--after repeatedly running the programme with a single flashair wifi logon, the programme crashes on run
--probably has something to do with the flahsair card
Workaround: turn the camera off, disconnect from the wifi network. Turn camera back on, connect to wifi network again.
